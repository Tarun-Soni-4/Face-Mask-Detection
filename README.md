# Face-Mask-Detection
By using Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV and Machine Learning I have done a way to detect whether a person is having Face Mask or not. 
Firstly we train many files both with mask and without mask.
Then when we run the program and test ourselves firstly the program detects our face, if the face is found it then tries to detect the mask and gives probability of detecting the mask. 

If we see green color we can confirm that the person is wearing mask.

If we see red color then the person is not wearing the mask properly or the person has no mask on his face.
